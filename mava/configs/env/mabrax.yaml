  - _self_

env_name: MaBrax  # Used for logging purposes and selection of the corresponding wrapper.
scenario:
  name: ant_4x2   # [ant_4x2, halfcheetah_6x1, hopper_3x1, humanoid_9|8, walker2d_2x3]

# Defines the metric that will be used to evaluate the performance of the agent.
# This metric is returned at the end of an experiment and can be used for hyperparameter tuning.
eval_metric: episode_return

# Whether the environment observations encode implicit agent IDs. If True, the AgentID wrapper is not used.
# Note: When using homogenisation_method = "max", a one-hot vector representing the agent ID is added.
# If the homogenisation method is changed, set this to False.
implicit_agent_id: True
# Whether or not to log the winrate of this environment. This should not be changed as not all
# environments have a winrate metric.
log_win_rate: False

kwargs:
  episode_length: 1000
  homogenisation_method: max # Default is None. Options: [max, concat] if dimensions of observations and actions are not homogeneous across agents.
